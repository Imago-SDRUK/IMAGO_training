# Imago Template Repository

This is the repository for hands-on workshops using *Imago: Data Service for Imagery* data products. Imago transforms satellite imagery into ready-to-use datasets for social science, health, and policy analysis. This workshop is designed for researchers, local authorities, NGOs, and anyone interested in applying imagery-derived evidence to neighbourhood-level challenges.

This workshop has been developed by the Imago team.

Whether you’re new to satellite data, experienced with geospatial tools, or primarily an Excel user, the workshop provides multiple entry points. By the end, users will be able to combine Imago data products with other widely used sources to address real social-policy questions.

## 🛠️ Contributing
The core Imago team will put together trainings using Imago data products. After that, everyone’s welcome to use the material and code for their own uses.
